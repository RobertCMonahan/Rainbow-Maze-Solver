# Rainbow Maze Solver

Solves mazes from given images and returns a colorful output of how the maze was solved along with the shortest route. Rainbow Maze Solver uses Dijkstra's algorithm to trace its way though the maze with a color gradient thereby showing where it attempted to go. When it finds the end it traces a green line back to the start, giving a clear path from start th finish.
